Perhaps there is some correlation to the MTU being used and how many<br>
segments can be sent into the window, interacting with SWS stuff. That<br>
the LAME stuff was smoother could be the use of a smaller MTU - 1500<br>
bytes right?<br>
<p>
Of course, the "right" way to do this is to take packet traces :) It<br>
might also help explain the jaggies for the larger than CIP MTUs -<br>
perhaps the chance that a given segment is corrupted is increased -<br>
seeing rtx's in the trace would show that - it could also be infered<br>
from netstat statistics on the sender and receiver. (retrans and<br>
checksum failures).<br>
