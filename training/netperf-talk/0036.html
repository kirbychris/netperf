www.netperf.org is in the process of coming online. if you have a couple<br>
cycles, feel free to point your browser at www.netperf.org. and let me<br>
know what you find. I know already that there is no index.html at "/." I<br>
hope to have one that is rather close to the NetperfPage.html page RSN.<br>
<p>
Work on netperf-talk@netperf.org is still inprogress. I have not created<br>
the list there yet as I am still not sure quite how I want to go about<br>
trying to make the list spam resistant. <br>
<p>
I was toying with the idea of making it a moderated list, but am not<br>
sure if I have enough time and availability to keep the moderators<br>
workload satisfied. The suggestion of a closed list has been made, which<br>
would indeed require "real" subscriptions and not any remailers.<br>
<p>
ftp.netperf.org awaits my figuring-out why wuftpd gives a null ls output<br>
where the HP supplied ftpd does not - probably a silly config setting I<br>
forgot. at present, ftp.netperf.org (once it runs wuftpd) will be just<br>
as picky about PTR records as ftp.cup.hp.com...<br>

these opinions are mine, all mine; HP might not want them anyway... :)
feel free to email, or post, but please do not do both...
