<i>&gt;Not to helpfull, but that is sort of the stuff I would go after.</i><br>
<i>&gt;(well first do what Rick said though, netstat.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;To get my idea of your config straight:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Two machines running netperf, interconnected with another dual interface</i><br>
<i>&gt;machine?</i><br>
<p>
<p>
Sorry, I should have made that clearer.  The setup originally was 3 computers:<br>
<p>
                  Router-box<br>
             ----------------------------------<br>
boxa ------ |  router-card-a    router-card-b  | ----- boxb<br>
             ----------------------------------<br>
<p>
Where boxa and boxb are each connected to the router box with a crossover<br>
cable.  It's about as simple as you can get to test a router, but right now<br>
I'm just running tests between boxa and router-card-a, in hopes  of getting<br>
a repeatable measure of thruput.  The router box has the second network<br>
card in and working, but nothing plugged into it.<br>
<p>
So routing shouldn't enter into it.  Duplex shouldn't either, really; I<br>
think the cards are at half duplex by default, but I'll double check<br>
anyway.  And no packets are being dropped, according to ifconfig.  Also, it<br>
happens in both directions, and it happens between router-card-b and boxb<br>
as well, when I plug that in, and for that matter between boxa and boxb, in<br>
both directions, if I string a crossover cable all the way across.<br>
<p>
I am in the process of exploring all suggestions, and thank you all very<br>
much for the feedback.  Additional ideas are still quite welcome.  I<br>
confess I was hoping someone would just tell me to tweak a kernel setting,<br>
but I guess I'll keep plugging away.<br>
<p>
Thanks again<br>
<p>
