Hi Rick,
<p>
I'll make this short.....
I'm running an NT workstation with netperf. I've installed Inetd from
Ockham technologies. The readme file that comes with Inetd suggests the
following:
<p>
Network aware programs, which do I/O over a windows socket, need to use
the
environment variable passed, INETD_SOCK, to obtain the socket handle
that inetd
has created for connecting the program to a remote user.
Inetd sets up this environment variable to the handle of a connected
socket
for a program. This socket handle is inherited by a program and is
already
accessible. So a network aware program only needs to add code similar to
the
following to make the program work:
<p>
  sock=atoi(getenv("INETD_SOCK"));
  recv(sock,...);
  send(sock,...);
<p>
I cann't do this because I got the precompiled exe files. Is there
another way of solving this problem? I really need netperf to perform
some tests on a satellite internet network and don't have much time
left, any help offered would be greately appreciated.
<p>
