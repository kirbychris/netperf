Generally speaking, in netperf 2.1, the netperf side sends and the<br>
netserver side receives. That is for any of the _STREAM tests. The _RR<br>
tests will both send and recieve in both netperf and netserver.<br>
<p>
Some of this may change in netperf3. For example, the netserver side of<br>
a DNS_RR test in netperf3 will be the one issuing the DNS requests where<br>
it used to be the netperf side in 2.1pl4.<br>
<p>
It would help if folks included the actual error messages in their<br>
email. Specifics are often helpful in diagnosis.<br>
<p>
happy benchmarking,<br>
