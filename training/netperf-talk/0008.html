I'm running on two dual-processor SMP machines.  I didn't realize that<br>
there was a parameter to indicate number of processors, so the first set<br>
of runs assumed the default of 1.  Utilizations for the local machine<br>
appeared to "bounce" around quite a bit between successive runs, but the<br>
remote utilization appeared very consistent.<br>
<p>
After realizing that I needed to tell netperf that there were 2<br>
processors, I reran the LOC_CPU and REM_CPU tests using the -n<br>
parameter.  I typically run these tests 5 times, just to see if<br>
everything is stable.  The runs on the local machine gave much lower<br>
numbers than those without the -n parameter and there was quite a bit of<br>
variation between the runs (the numbers dropped from values in the<br>
242000 to 243000 range without the -n to values in the 203000 to 205000<br>
range with the -n parameter).  The remote machine numbers remained at<br>
the same level as those without the -n parameter and there was very<br>
little variation between the runs (numbers in the 242000 range with<br>
variation over all 5 samples of only 30).<br>
<p>
This brings up my questions:  Does netserver need to be started with the<br>
-n parameter to get the remote machine to know that it has<br>
multiprocessors?  How does the -n parameter to netperf indicate whether<br>
there are MP's on the local machine versus the remote machine (i.e. what<br>
if the local machine is a uniprocessor but the remote machine is an<br>
SMP)?<br>
