Folks -<br>
<p>
For literally months now, messages to the list have resulted in mailer<br>
daemon messages for blacksheep@mail.gvcl1.bc.wave.home.com. Generally,<br>
when I get such a message more than once or twice, I go in and remove<br>
the offending entry from the list.<br>
<p>
However, blacksheep does not appear in the list - I suspect that they<br>
are the forwarding destination of some other entry.<br>
<p>
I'd like to try and find the entry. The first thought on how to do that<br>
would be to binary search the list - cut the list in half (temporarily),<br>
send a test message, wait for a response, iterate as needed. That could<br>
mean a number of otherwise bogus messages though, so I thought I would<br>
ask folks first.<br>
<p>
I guess the other solution is for me to get off my arse and finally get<br>
majordomo setup on netperf.org and have everyone move their subscription<br>
:)<br>
<p>
thoughts,<br>
