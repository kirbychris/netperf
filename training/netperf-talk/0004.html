Folks -<br>
<p>
Seems that netperf-talk has been discovered for real by the spammers. By<br>
way of trying to fix that, does anyone know of a version of majordomo or<br>
something that would only allow mail from members of the list? If given<br>
a point to it, and enough people were willing to go that way, I'd be<br>
willing to get it set-up.<br>
