Ok, I know i'm out of my field here, but i'd appreciate any help.  I'm<br>
using netperf to test the performance between a pair of Intel's<br>
EtherExpress Pro/100 100Mbs cards, each on a Linux box (RedHat 5.2, kernel<br>
2.0.36).  I'm just running a basic<br>
<p>
	netperf -l 30 -H boxb <br>
<p>
The results from a series of 30-second tests seem to be bifurcated,<br>
clustering around either 12 or 80 Mbs, which are obviously way different<br>
numbers:<br>
<p>
11,82,12,12,83,13,11,14,12,83,83,60,83,12,83,44,83,83,83,14<br>
<p>
Ok, i thought, that will smooth out if we up it to 60 seconds.  But, as<br>
they say, "NOT":<br>
<p>
83,13,13,83,83,83,15,12,12,13,83,13,83,13,83,12,82,83,14,83<br>
<p>
Even at 30 minutes, it is by no means nice and smooth and repeatable,<br>
although it's not as bad as the shorter tests.  But if anyone can give me a<br>
hint what's going on here, I'd appreciate it.  One box has 2 network cards,<br>
because I wanted to test it as a router (once I had some baseline numbers<br>
to compare the router performance to :-(  But anyway, I don't see why two<br>
cards in a box should matter.  I've cut down on the number of other<br>
processes running on each box to the bare minimum.  Each box has 32MB of<br>
memory, which should be plenty to prevent any kind of swapping.  I've<br>
toggled the '-- -D' option, to no effect.  Debug output doesn't give me any<br>
insight.<br>
<p>
Thanks for any help.<br>
