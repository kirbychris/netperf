<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I am trying to find out how long does it take to send packet by using</i><br>
<i>&gt; follwing command line .</i><br>
<i>&gt; cliensite&gt; netperf -c -l -1024 -t TCP_STREAM -H &lt;IP ADDRESS&gt; -P 10021 -- -s</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1028 -S 1028</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I am suppose to ge time it take to send packet to remote host, I am</i><br>
<i>&gt; not getting any info about time. If you any thing about thsi please</i><br>
<i>&gt; reply me . I would appriciate your help.</i><br>
<p>
What "time" are you looking to find? Wall-clock time, or CPU time?<br>
None of the netperf tests are set-up to (directly) measure the<br>
unidirectional time it takes to send a packet from netperf to<br>
netserver.  That would require smarts that netperf just does not<br>
have. (and perhaps some rather well-synchronized clocks as well...)<br>
<p>
One can make a decent first-order approximation of the wall-clock time<br>
by using the netperf TCP_RR test. Take the transactoin rate, invert<br>
it, and then divide by two. This assumes symmetry which may not be<br>
there in anything other than a simple topology, but it would be a<br>
start.<br>
<p>
If you meant CPU time, then you want to enable CPU utilizatoin<br>
measurements, and then start doing some arithmatic with the serice<br>
demands.<br>
