In a NetPerf test on NT does the server send or receive?  I am getting huge<br>
RCV_BUFFERS errors on my "sending" side and no errors whatsoever on my<br>
"receiving (Server)" side.  Now I am beginning to think that my Server side<br>
is actually sending not receiving as I previously thought.<br>
<p>
Thanks,<br>
