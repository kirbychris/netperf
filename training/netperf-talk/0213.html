Hi all.<br>
<p>
I am going to design and implement a performance monitoring solution for my<br>
company's network (LAN/WAN).  My requirements include availability and<br>
end-to-end response time.  I am looking at netperf to take these<br>
measurements, and it seems OK up to now... but I have however some<br>
questions:<br>
<p>
- netperf is clearly designed as a network performance "benchmark" more than<br>
as a continuous monitoring tool.  Does anybody actually use netperf to<br>
perform regular tests (from cron for instance) ?  Any issues doing this ?<br>
<p>
- netperf is quite flexible in terms of protocol selection (I wish to use<br>
UDP), request/response packet sizes, socket buffer sizes and more...  BUT is<br>
there a way I could get a round-trip time (instead of the trx/sec) ?  Is it<br>
safe to simply invert the trx/sec value for an estimation of the round-trip<br>
time (in sec) ?<br>
<p>
- Using the "-P 0" argument, it is quite simple to parse netperf output.<br>
Has anybody done this already ?  Wishing to share some code maybe ?<br>
<p>
Thanks for such a great program anyway :)<br>
