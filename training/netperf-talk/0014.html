<i>&gt;Has anyone ported or attempted to port Netperf to VxWorks?  If so, I would</i><br>
<i>&gt;appreciate information as to how successful the port has been.  Even if the</i><br>
<i>&gt;port has not been successful, I would still like to receive information</i><br>
<i>&gt;concerning the problems that were encountered during the porting effort.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Also, does anyone have any opinion on whether it would be possible to</i><br>
<i>&gt;successfully port netperf to VxWorks within a reasonble amount of time</i><br>
<i>&gt;(i.e., &lt; 1 month)?</i><br>
<p>
We (Newton Group) have ported the netperf client to the Newton O/S - a<br>
small, threaded, resource constrained, system (deceased). Given that the<br>
Newton o/s dosn't have a file system or any system level (c++) user<br>
interface APIs and it has a set of entirely unique system and TCP/IP APIs,<br>
it went quite well - it took about two-three man weeks. I would have thought<br>
that the client could be ported in less time &amp; less hassle for VxWorks.<br>
<p>
We found it very useful in driving through-put issues and assessing<br>
bottle-necks - we got up to the blistering rate of ~1Mbit/s using 10Mbit<br>
PCMCIA ethernet!! - mostly limited by bus band-width.<br>
