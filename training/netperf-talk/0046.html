Netperf'ers :<br>
<p>
I am testing the throughput of a Sun E10000 using their Gigabit Ethernet <br>
adapters (resold alteon cards) using netperf.  <br>
<p>
A couple of questions about how netperf bases it`s throughput #'s (Mbps).<br>
<p>
	Assume that for these questions / statements, that I am only using a<br>
	cross-over cable between 2 NIC's on 2 separate systems.<br>
<p>
-	Is the throughput (Mbps) # based strictly on Unidirectional writing <br>
	of data and timing it's completion, using some statistical passing<br>
	of results... between client and server ??  Would this be considered<br>
	half-duplex ??  In either case, if I run netperf on both systems<br>
	simultaniously (reporting 190 Mbps on both systems, from each netperf),<br>
	does this mean that I add up the 2 system throughput #'s to get the<br>
	'FUll DUPLEX' throughput ?? (380 Mbps ??), or does Netperf take into<br>
	account and use the timing of both the sending and receiving sockets, <br>
	based on the total # of bytes transmitted and received (handshaking) <br>
	even in a unidirectional transfer ??<br>
<p>
-	Given that this Sun VGE driver operates only at a FULL duplex mode,<br>
	does this preclude me to the belief that only having one system <br>
	transmitting data to another (in a single direction), that this only <br>
	can be called 'half-duplex', thus not being allowed to consume more <br>
	than half of the bandwidth ???  I don't believe so, but please correct <br>
	me if I am wrong.  I understood the dynamics of ethernet throughput to <br>
	simply allow for a maximum amount of data (bandwidth) to be carried on <br>
	the media overall (total of both sides  eg. 100Mbps sending, 900 Mbps <br>
	receiveing ; if true Gbps were achievable).<br>
<p>
	This leads me into the question of Collision detection not being<br>
	a factor (or even possible) when using 'Full Duplex' ethernet .?<br>
	Does this mean that even though no collisions/errors are reported<br>
	by the device driver, that collisions could still be occuring ??, or<br>
	does this mean that collisions are physically impossible, given that<br>
	two separate 'channels' are multiplexed over the media ???  Is this<br>
	one of the reasons that 'Full Duplex' ethernet is usually (if not<br>
	always) wired so that a switch is the connecting device between nodes,<br>
	rather than allowing several nodes to transmit simultaniously without<br>
	collision detection ??  Please enlighten me on all of the nitty-gritty<br>
	details, as I have not yet received any 'good' explanations as of yet.<br>
<p>
	For the Sun folks, what are the 10 or 15 'vge' driver parameters exactly<br>
	used for ???  Is there an internal doc or docs that describe various<br>
	tested configurations ???  I've been told to do different things by<br>
	both support and the configuration manuals...<br>
<p>
	Please respond as soon as possible, since the customer(s) at lucent<br>
	are becoming VERY uneasy after spending sooo... much money, not to <br>
	get the expected bandwith from Gigabit Ethernet (unless the tools are<br>
	deceiving us) ??<br>
<p>
<p>
Thanks,<br>
