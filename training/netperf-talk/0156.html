Assuming you've already made sure that you did ont accidentally talk<br>
over loopback, you might want to find-out if anything along the path<br>
knows how to "compress" data. By default netperf sends whatever happens<br>
to be in the buffers allocated - and as often as not, that is a bunch of<br>
zeros, which would compress rather well.<br>
<p>
There is a -F option to take data from a file and use that to fill the<br>
buffers. <br>
