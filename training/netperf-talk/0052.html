<p>
There are differences in when the timing starts in FTP get versus put,<br>
wich means that for small transfers, there can be a big difference in<br>
the measured times. Also, different systems can have different socket<br>
buffer sizes, which can affect perforamnce differently depending on<br>
whether the large socket buffer is the one sending or receiving.<br>
<p>
<i>&gt; Should Netperf also include some kind of "server's side" timing, like</i><br>
<i>&gt; TTCP does?</i><br>
<p>
I think the timing should be relative to the system sending the data,<br>
and it should include the time it takes to ensure that all the data has<br>
gotten to the other side (hence the waiting for the two shutdwon calls).<br>
