Known Names for the Netperf Database
</H1>

<H2>
<IMG SRC="http:/images/cauticon.pm" ALT="CAUTION!">
The names presented on this page are provided for solely for the
purpose of making submittals and retrievals of the netperf database
easier and less error-prone. In providing this information,
Hewlett-Packard makes NO endorsement of any kind. Please be certain
you have read the
<A HREF="/netperf/NetperfDisclaim.html">disclaimer</A>
before going any further.
</H2>

This page contains guidelines and lists of identifiers for the various
fields in the submittal and retrieval forms. You can use this first
list to go straight to the identifier list that interests you.

<A NAME="model"><HR>Model Names</A>
</H2>
<P>
Model names are free-form keywords. They should closely follow the
common name for that model and be sufficiently detailed to
differentiate one model from another. For example, at the time of
this writing, there were six different models of HP 9000/715 so
stating simply "715" would be too vague. Each differed in clock-rate,
so the model names for them would be 715/33, 715/50, and so on. The
model name does not need to include an indication of vendor.

<A NAME="sysvend">System Vendors</A>
</H2>
<P>
To insure that your submittal is more easily retrieved by others, it
is suggested that you use the following identifiers to represent the
various system vendors. If you wish to submit numbers for a system
from a vendor not on this list, please feel free to do so, using a
value of "Other" and place the vendor name in the "Comments" section
of the submittal form. At the same time, please use the 
<A HREF="mailto:netperf-feedback@netperf.org">feedback</A>
page so the maintainers of the database can update this list.
</P>
<P>
When retrieving numbers, you may also use "Other" or you may try what
you think the vendor's name might be.

<A NAME="release">Release Numbers</A>
</H2>
A release numbers are free-form keywords. They should be sufficiently
detailed to allow others to order the software if they wish to
reproduce your results. For Unix operating systems, the output of
"uname -r" is often a good choice (though perhaps not for Solaris).
Your mileage will vary for other software - such as transport or
driver software.

<H2>
<A NAME="os">Operating Systems</A>
</H2>
<P>
To insure that your submittal is more easily retrieved by others, it
is suggested that you use the following identifiers to represent the
various operating systems. If you wish to submit numbers for a system
running an OS not on this list, please feel free to do so, using an
identifier of "Other" and include the real name in the Comments
section. At the same time,please use the  
<A HREF="mailto:netperf-feedback@netperf.org">feedback</A>

<P>
The following are the currently known Transport Vendors. Please use
these names when accessing the database. If the transport software
came with the operating system, use the term "Bundled." If the
transport software came from a vendor not on this list, use the term
"Other" and list the name of the transport provider in the Comments
section. Please use the 
<A HREF="mailto:netperf-feedback@netperf.org">feedback</A>
page to let the maintainers know to update this list.

  <DT> Bundled
