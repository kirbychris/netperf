could be potential problems with numbers, this page will be updated.

<P>The utility and accuracy of the netperf database is left entirely
to its users. It is critical that <EM>you</EM> make sure that the
methodologies you follow are apropriate, and that the numbers you
submit are complete and accurate.

<P>To that end, here are some important considerations:
<UL>
<LI> When specifying the names of system, transport, or interface
     vendors, network an bus types, or operating systems, please use
     the names listed in 
     <A HREF="/netperf/numbers/NetperfIDs.html">the name list</A>.
<LI> All tests should be of at least 60 seconds duration.
<LI> The <EM>entire</EM> output of netperf should be included.
<LI> The <EM>entire</EM> netperf command line should be included.
<LI> The system models should be specified completely.
<LI> The results submitted should be repeatable.
<LI> The submitter's name and email address should be included.
<LI> The comments area should be used to explain those aspects of the
test not covered by the rest of the submittal form.
<LI> All of the independent/concurrent tests of an aggregate result
should run for the same length of time, and report similar results. An
aggregate result should be reported under the test type of "Other" and
be fully explaied in the comments section.
<LI> The measurement of MP systems is somewhat problematic. It is
unlikely that a single instance of netperf would be sufficient to
utilize the total resources of an MP system. However, it is still
interesting to see what effect MP has on a single-connection speed
metric. Beyond that, MP systems may be measured with aggregate test
methods. 
<LI> All sumbittals should be for a single data-point. Nothing
explicitly prevents the submission of many datapoints at a time.
However, the output parsing features of the submittal program will
stop once they find the first instance of a result. This first result
will be the one displayed in summary output - the remainder of the
submittal will still be present and may be viewed with the
"long-form."
</UL>
