This page is in BETA status only. As I find more things that could be
potential problems with numbers, I will be adding to this page.

<P>The utility and accuracy of the netperf database is left entirely
to its users. It is critical that <EM>you</EM> make sure that the
methodologies you follow are apropriate, and that the numbers you
submit are complete and accurate.

<P>To that end, here are some important considerations:
<UL>
<LI> All tests should be of at least 60 seconds duration.
<LI> The <EM>entire</EM> output of netperf should be included.
<LI> The <EM>entire</EM> netperf command line should be included.
<LI> The system models should be specified completely.
<LI> The results submitted should be repeatable.
<LI> The submitter's name and email address should be included.
<LI> The comments area should be used to explain those aspects of the
test not covered by the rest of the submittal form.
<LI> All of the independent/concurrent tests of an aggregate result
should run for the same length of time, and report similar results. An
aggregate result should be reported under the test type of "Other" and
be fully explaied in the comments section.
<LI> The measurement of MP systems is somewhat problematic. It is
unlikely that a single instance of netperf would be sufficient to
utilize the total resources of an MP system. However, it is still
interesting to see what effect MP has on a single-connection speed
metric. Beyond that, MP systems may be measured with aggregate test
methods.
