Sadly, when netperf.org migrated from one platform to another, the "db"
application it was using was no longer available.  As such, it is no 
longer possible to submit/retrieve performance numbers for netperf as 
it was in the past.

For the intensely curious, the last contents of the netperf results database
can be found at <A HREF="/netperf/data">the data subdirectory</A> which
contains a flat ASCII file and a .h file describing its layout.
