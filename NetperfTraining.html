<P>
There is a 
<a href="/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/netperf-talk">
mailing list </a> for discussion of netperf with an <a
href="/netperf/training/netperf-talk/index.html"> old archive </a> of
previous discussions.  Hopefully, a <A href="http://www.netperf.org/pipermail/netperf-talk/">new archive </A> will be up and running shortly.

<P>
If you would like to browse the netperf manual in 
<A HREF="/netperf/training/Netperf.html">html</A> be advised that it
is about 67KB in length.

You can also look at a copy of the 
<A HREF="/netperf/training/netperf.ps">manual</A>
in Postscript (2.75 MB), or the 
<A HREF="/netperf/training/netperf.man">netperf manpage</A>
in text, or the
<A HREF="/netperf/training/netserver.man">netserver manpage</A>
also in text. At the moment, this page is under construction,
so please bear with us.
<P>

The maintainers of this service are very anxious to find better ways
to convert Interleaf documents to HTML. This conversion should include
text, graphics, tables, and charts. They are especially interested in
ways to use CyberLeaf to break-up a single Interleaf document into
multiple pages.  If you have any advice on these matters, please use
the
<A HREF="mailto:netperf-feedback@netperf.org">feedback</A>
form to communicate it to us. Thanks muchly.
